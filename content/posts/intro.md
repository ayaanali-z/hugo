description: I coded this in two hours on a random Sunday in Vim.

I developed this site using a tool called [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) which is a static site generator written in the programming language [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language)#). I am not skilled at front-end development in any way but also did not want to just use a random template and host on Wix or Squarespace. I used Hugo for a few reasons: 
- Speed: this is a blazing fast site. Near instantaneous transitions between pages. 
- Free and Open-Source: goes without saying why this is a plus. 
- Better themes: I used a theme called Archie for this site. 
- Control: essentially, while this is a site generator and not a formal web development framework, I still retain complete control over how the site is presented and organized.  

This site is hosted for free on GitHub pages.
