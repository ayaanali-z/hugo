# Hugo for Static Sites 

It took me several tries at learning React, JS, and WebGL before I landed on hugo. I realized all of those tools were insanely overkill for what I was trying to accomplish: a portfolio site for someone who does not care for front-end development. Hugo is basically Wix but for back-end programmers. I coded the entire site from my Mac terminal and launched it on GitHub pages. How much actual front-end did I use? Like 3-4 lines of CSS to change the font colors. In reality, most of my efforts were finding a theme I liked and then cloning the git repository in my quickstart folder.
