# What is LaTeX? 

LaTeX is a typesetting and document preparation system that provides a similar function to word processors like Google Docs or Microsoft Word. However, LaTeX differs from these applications in that the user writes in plain text. 

## Corollary: What is plain text? 

Plain text is text that contains only characters and spaces without any stylistic or structural formatting already compiled on the page. To put it bluntly, you're essentially coding a google document. 

# Back to LaTeX 

For the vast majority of people, MS Word or Google Docs (if you're a member of Gen-Z) is adequate for creating well-formatted, aesthetically pleasing documents. LaTeX, however, is widely used in academia for its decreased emphasis on customizability in favor of a standardized font called "Computer Modern." Created by Stanford computer scientist Donald Knuth, LaTeX is used in fields such as linguistics, psychology, the natural sciences, physics, and economics.

# The True Value

LaTeX is most useful when constructing and presenting mathematical formulae. The famous `amsmath` package provides commands and functions to create vividly complex mathematical symbols that are incredibly useful when writing deeply theoretical computer science and mathematics research papers, books, and essays.

# Who should use LaTeX? 

The most obvious answer are professional researchers in mathematics and computer science or any field in which representing mathematical formulae in published works is a necessity. For students in STEM programs, I would only use LaTeX for the following reasons: 
- It is required for your class.
- Your handwriting is terrible, and I mean truly incomprehensible. 
- You want to build the skill should you enter academic research.
 
Do not try to take typed notes in LaTeX. Unless you have an average WPM of 150+ and have memorized all the relevant commands, it is highly unlikely that you would be able to keep up with a lecturer. 

# Quickest way to get started in LaTeX? 

[Overleaf](overleaf.com) is a free web-based editor for LaTeX documents. Check if your institution has access to the premium version of the software. 

# Finally, how is it pronounced? 

I usually lean on the "lay-tech" pronounciation, but my discrete mathematics professor (who taught me LaTeX) always used "lah-tech" as their go-to saying.
