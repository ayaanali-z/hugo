Hi! My name is Ayaan Ali, and I am a B.A. candidate in mathematics and computer science at [Columbia University](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/ "Department Website"). I grew up in Brooklyn, NY and chose to stay in the city for higher education. Academically, I'm mainly interested in the theory of computation, computational learning theory, and pure mathematics. Eventually, I hope to pursue a PhD in CS and conduct research full time. In my free time, I postulate a lot about media and film as well as data analysis and visualization. Below are some of my random opinions. 

# Vim Enthusiast 

This has been [memed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1dtmzqnCU "Vim Interview") to oblivion, but I prefer using Vim for software development. I mainly blame this on Prof. Jae Lee's Advanced Programming course where I was forced to learn the magnificence of this text editor. However, there are a lot of reasons for using Vim over an IDE like VSCode or IntelliJ. 

- Immediate Terminal Access 
- Minimalist Coding Environment 
- Customization and DotFile Configurations 
- Exceptionally Fast Startups
- Remote Editing and Easy SSH Access 
- Seamless Git Integration 
- Potential for Mastery 

In all honesty though, coding on Vim just looks cooler. After months of developing and picking up CLI tricks and quality-of-life commands, a programmer barely has to touch the mouse when working with Vim. It is the sole reason that my favorite Mac app is Terminal. 

# Writing 

The main influences to my writing are as follows: 
- AP English Language and Composition with Mr. Evan Losow 
- Literature Humanities II with Prof. Jeffrey Wayno 
- Reporting University News @ Columbia Daily Spectator 
- Studying Mathematical Logic 
- [The Elements of Style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Style "Book's Wikipedia") by Prof. William Strunk Jr. and E.B. White 
- The Criticism of [Roger Ebert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Ebert "Ebert"), [Richard Brody](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Brody "Brody"), and [A.O. Scott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._O._Scott "Scott")

Generally, I aim to be concise. Why express something with four words when you only need one?
