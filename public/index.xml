      <description>What is LaTeX? LaTeX is a typesetting and document preparation system that provides a similar function to word processors like Google Docs or Microsoft Word. However, LaTeX differs from these applications in that the user writes in plain text.
Corollary: What is plain text? Plain text is text that contains only characters and spaces without any stylistic or structural formatting already compiled on the page. To put it bluntly, you&amp;rsquo;re essentially coding a google document.</description>

      <description>Hugo for Static Sites It took me several tries at learning React, JS, and WebGL before I landed on hugo. I realized all of those tools were insanely overkill for what I was trying to accomplish: a portfolio site for someone who does not care for front-end development. Hugo is basically Wix but for back-end programmers. I coded the entire site from my Mac terminal and launched it on GitHub pages.</description>

      <description>Hi! My name is Ayaan Ali, and I am a B.A. candidate in mathematics and computer science at Columbia University. I grew up in Brooklyn, NY and chose to stay in the city for higher education. Academically, I&amp;rsquo;m mainly interested in the theory of computation, computational learning theory, and pure mathematics. Eventually, I hope to pursue a PhD in CS and conduct research full time. In my free time, I postulate a lot about media and film as well as data analysis and visualization.</description>
